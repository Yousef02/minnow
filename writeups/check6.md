Checkpoint 6 Writeup
====================

My name: [Yousef AbuHashem]

My SUNet ID: [Yousef AbuHashem]

I collaborated with: [paxtonsc]

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: [joonkeep]

This checkpoint took me about [1] hours to do. I [did] attend the lab session.

Solo portion:

- Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself? [y]

- Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt? [y]

- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps:

Group portion:

- Who is your lab partner (and what is their SUNet ID, e.g. "winstein")?
Paxton Scott (Paxtonsc)

- Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as ``client'' or as ``server'')? 
Yes!

- Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two
  implementations, with contents identical upon receipt?
When I was the client and Paxton was the server, it worked perfectly. When Paxton was the client, he had a seg fault on hid side. 


- Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass
  these steps, either by you or your lab partner.
  I am still not sure what steps Paxton is doing to fix the segfault he gets when he is the client, but I did not change anything.
  To make sure the problem was not from my end, we both ran the solo version with two terminals. While mine worked perfectly, he still got a segfault sometimes.

Creative portion (if you did anything for our creative challenge,
                  please boast about it!)

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: [describe]

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]

- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
